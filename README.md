My learning resources used on the process of setting up a mobile automation framework for our Android app. My starting point:
few Java, no Espresso, vague Jenkins.

## Java

Brush up some before diving in Espresso: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java

### Espresso

Start here:

```
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidTestingEspresso/article.html
```

Grab a cheat sheet:

```
https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/cheatsheet/
```
Start playing with Espresso Record feature:

```
https://developer.android.com/studio/test/espresso-test-recorder.html
```

Brew some coffee and read some Espresso examples:

```

```

Grab some robots here:

```

```

### Jenkins

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Spoon

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Android

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And then get some more

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
