My learning resources used on the process of setting up a mobile automation framework for our Android app. My starting point:
few Java, no Espresso, vague Jenkins.

## Java

Brush up some before diving in Espresso: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java

## Espresso

Start here:

```
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidTestingEspresso/article.html
```

Grab a cheat sheet:

```
https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/cheatsheet/
```
Start playing with Espresso Record feature:

```
https://developer.android.com/studio/test/espresso-test-recorder.html
```

Brew some coffee and read some Espresso examples:

```

```

Grab some robots here:

```

```

## Jenkins

Our CI of choice. We use Jenkins Pipeline to have a "stage view" of each step. This is great to debug what whent wrong when building your pull request.

```
https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md
```

Your Android project can have a file called Jenkinsfile with the intended configuration. More flexible than using the UI offered by Jenkins.

```
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/
```

## Spoon

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

## Android

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And then get some more

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
