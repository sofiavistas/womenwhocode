My learning resources used on the process of setting up a mobile automation framework for our Android app. My starting point:
few Java, no Espresso, vague Jenkins.

## Java

Brush up some before diving in Espresso: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java

## Espresso

Step 1 –  Start here:

```
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidTestingEspresso/article.html
```

Step 2 – Grab a cheat sheet:

```
https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/cheatsheet/
```
Step 3 – Start playing with Espresso Record feature:

```
https://developer.android.com/studio/test/espresso-test-recorder.html
```

Step 4 – Brew some coffee and read some Espresso examples:

```

```

 Step 5 – Grab some robots here:

```

## Jenkins

Our CI of choice. We use Jenkins Pipeline to have a "stage view" of each step. This is great to debug what whent wrong when building your pull requests.

```
https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md
```

Your Android project can have a file called Jenkinsfile with the intended configuration. More flexible than using the UI offered by Jenkins.

```
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/
```

## Spoon

Great report tool from folks at Square:

```

```

## Android

How to go and mockup that API:
